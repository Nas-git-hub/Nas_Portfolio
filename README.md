## Prediction Model: https://github.com/Nas-git-hub/Prediction-model.git
A machine learning model that is trained to accept data and predict future values of that data with minimal prediction error. 
*	Downloaded weather data from Historical Hourly Weather Data 2012-2017 | Kaggle and saved locally as csv file 
*	Used python in data cleaning proceedure (ie removed unwanted colums, dropped empty rows, removed duplicates and standardized outliners)
*	Read the data in excel using only the temperature and hour parameters and I indexed the hour column
*	I plot the temperature to time graph using the first half of the dataset
*	Using sqlearn library and the arima model I developed a training algorythm using the initial first half of the data set to train and predict the second half 
*	The model responded with numerous running with a minimal rms.
