# Data Analysis Portfolio
## [Prediction Model](https://github.com/Nas-git-hub/Prediction-model.git)
A machine learning model that is trained to accept data and predict future values of that data with minimal prediction error. 
*	Downloaded weather data from Historical Hourly Weather Data 2012-2017 | Kaggle and saved locally as csv file 
*	Used python in data cleaning proceedure (ie removed unwanted colums, dropped empty rows, removed duplicates and standardized outliners)
*	Read the data in excel using only the temperature and hour parameters and I indexed the hour column
*	I plot the temperature to time graph using the first half of the dataset
*	Using sqlearn library and the arima model I developed a training algorythm using the initial first half of the data set to train and predict the second half 
*	The model responded with numerous running with a minimal rms.

## [Analyzing data with visualizations](https://github.com/Nas-git-hub/Analyzing-Automobile-sales.git)  
* Downloaded an already cleaned dataset which was artificially created for the purpose of 
  the project.
* Developed a Line chart using the functionality of pandas to show how automobile sales 
  fluctuate from year to year.
* Plot different lines for categories of vehicle type and analyse the trend to find out if there
  is a noticeable difference in sales trends between different vehicle types during recession periods.
* Used the functionality of Seaborn Library and pandas to create a visualizations to compare the sales 
  trend in various periods to gain insights to data.

## [Data Dashboarding with Dash and Plotly](https://github.com/Nas-git-hub/Dashboard-with-Dash-and-Plotly.git) 
This dashboard is to explore patterns and trends to gain insight on behaviors of wildfires per year in regions in Australia. 
 * Used plotly and dash framework to develop an interactive web dashboard for visualization
